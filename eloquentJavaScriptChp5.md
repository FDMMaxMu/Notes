### Higher-Order Function:
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.

Varialbe declared inside inner functions do not endup in the environment of the outer function.

### JSON:
Full name: JavaScript Object Notation

All property names have to be:
- surrounded by double quotes,
- only simple data expressions are allows -- no function calls, variables, or anything that involves actual computation.

methods that operate on JSON -- JSON.stringify(), JSON.parse()

### Transforming with map:
The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values.

Building up all those intermediate arrays is somewhat expensive.
